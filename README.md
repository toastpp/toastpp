Toast++ - Image Reconstruction in Optical Tomography
====================================================

2008-2016 (c) Martin Schweiger and Simon Arridge, University College London

Toast++ is an open-source software suite for image reconstruction in optical
tomography. It is developed by Martin Schweiger and Simon Arridge at University
College London.

The TOAST suite is available for download online at http://toastplusplus.org.

Please check the TOAST web site regularly for updates.

Toast++ is distributed with a GPL v3 license. Please see file COPYING for
details.

Downloading Toast++
-------------------

Pre-compiled binaries for several computer platforms are hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/toastpp/toastpp/releases

You will need to download two zip files:
- The "Common" package containing device-independent scripts and examples
- One of the platform-dependent packages for Windows, Linux or Mac-OS.

Installing precompiled Toast++ packages
---------------------------------------

If you are using the pre-compiled packages, just unzip both packages into *the
same* directory. You should end up with a single "toast" root directory.

Note that some unzip utilities, in particular on Windows, store the zip contents
under a directory named after the zip file, e.g. `toast_v2.0.0_common.zip`  -> 
`toast_v2.0.0_common/`

In that case, you will end up with two separate directories, and must merge the
two toast subdirectories from both manually.

Preparing the Toast++ environment
---------------------------------

(Required for both precompiled and compiled installations)

On Linux, type from the terminal prompt:

```
cd <toast root dir>
export TOASTDIR=$PWD
source toastenv.sh
```

This step can be skipped for Windows and OS X installations.

To set the Toast++ paths for the Matlab toolbox, type from the Matlab prompt:

```
cd <toast root dir>
mtoast2_install
```

Save the paths to make them permanent.

Getting started:
----------------
After setting up the TOAST toolbox, you can start by running the included
demos. In Matlab, type

```
doc
```

Follow the link to the Toast++ Toolbox documentation under "Supplemental
Software". This will bring up the main help page of the Toast++ toolbox.
Here you find links to the Toast demos (under "Live examples") and tutorial
scripts (under "Script tutorials"). It also contains a brief introduction to
DOT and links to the Toast++ homepage.

To view a list of the available commands in the Toolbox, type

```
doc toast2 (lists the core classes and functions)
doc utilities (lists auxiliary functions)
doc gui (lists a few sample applications with user interface)
```

For troubleshooting, please refer to the TOAST Frequently Asked Question
page and the message board, accessible from the TOAST home page. If you
cannot resolve a problem, you can contact the authors via the Contacts page.

Building from source
--------------------

The Toast++ sources are available from GitHub:
(https://github.com/toastpp/toastpp)

To clone the current development version:

```
git clone https://github.com/toastpp/toastpp.git
```

Follow the instructions under doc/install to build.
