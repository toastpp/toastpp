What is the TOAST toolbox?

<h1>What is the TOAST toolbox?</h1>
<p>The TOAST toolbox is a Matlab interface to the functions in the TOAST
libraries. It consists of
<ul>
<li>MEX files which provide Matlab functions that link directly to TOAST
    library functions.
<li>M files that provide additional high-level functionality making use
    of Matlab numerics and visualisation routines.
<li>Application scripts which contain complete examples of forward and
    inverse solvers for optical tomography reconstruction problems.
<li>Help files, examples and demos.
</ul>
<p>Matlab provides a development environment that allows rapid prototyping
and is better suited for development, debugging and visualisation than
the native TOAST C++ code.
<p>It should be noted however that the toolbox can be slower and less
memory-efficient than an equivalent C++ solution.
