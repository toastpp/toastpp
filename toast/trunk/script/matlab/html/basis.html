Basis definitions
</div>

<h1>Basis definitions</h1>
<p>A <i>basis</i> is used to approximate a continuous function in space <i>f(<b>r</b>)</i>
by an approximation <i>g(<b>r</b>)</i> = &Sigma;<i><sub>i</sub></i> <i>g<sub>i</sub> u<sub>i</sub>(<b>r</b>)</i>,
where <i>g<sub>i</sub></i> are basis coefficients, and <i>u<sub>i</sub>(<b>r</b>)</i> are basis functions.

<p>Given an <i>n</i>-dimensional basis <i>B = {u<sub>i</sub>}</i> over the domain,
an image <i>f</i> can then be expressed by an <i>n</i>-dimensional coefficient vector
<i>G = {g<sub>i</sub>)</i>.

<p>TOAST uses a number of different basis definitions for specific tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>Mesh (h)</b>. A piecewise polynomial basis defined by an unstructured mesh.
This basis is used by the forward solver module to define the finite element light transport model.
<li><b>Grid (g)</b>. A piecewise bi- or tri-linear regular basis. The g-basis is generally used as an
intermediate step to map between the forward and inverse bases. It is usually of higher resolution than the
inverse basis.
<li><b>Basis (b)</b>. A piecewise bi- or tri-linear regular basis for the inverse solver. This is the
basis in which the reconstructed images are expressed. The b-basis defines a rectangular or box-shaped volume
that may contain voxels which are outside the original object domain. It is useful for displaying reconstruction
results.
<li><b>Solution (s)</b>. A subset of the b-basis which excludes any voxels with no overlap with the
object domain. All solution vectors in the inverse solver module are expressed in this basis.
</ul>

<h2>Basis mapping</h2>
<p>A common task in a TOAST script is to map an image between different basis definitions. This can
be done with the mapping functions provided by the <i>basis mapper</i> object. A basis mapper is
created with the <a href="toastSetBasis.html">toastSetBasis</a> function:
<div class="code">
hBasis = toastSetBasis(hMesh,gdim,bdim)
</div>
where hMesh is a mesh handle (obtained for example by a call to <a href="toastReadMesh.html">toastReadMesh</a>),
which defines the h-basis. gdim and bdim are integer vectors of size 2 or 3 defining the dimensions of the g-basis
and b-basis, respectively. These bases are automatically aligned with the bounding box of the mesh.
The s-basis is created by the basis mapper by checking the overlap of the b-basis with the h-basis.

<p>The returned handle for the mapper object, hBasis, can then be used with one of the mapping functions
to map an image from one basis to another, for example
<div class="code">
b_img = toastMapMeshToBasis (hBasis, h_img)
</div>

<p>If the last parameter in the call to toastSetBasis is omitted,
<div class="code">
hBasis = toastSetBasis(hMesh,dim)
</div>
then the intermediate (g) basis is not generated. In this case, g and b basis are considered equivalent,
and the mapping between them is the identity. This is more efficient than specifying both gdim and bdim with
identical dimensions.

<p>Because the mapping between b and s basis only involves the removal of unsupported voxels, it can
be implemented by a permutation array. You can obtain this array by a call to
<a href="toastSolutionMask.html">toastSolutionMask</a>:
<div class="code">
mask = toastSolutionMask(hBasis)
</div>
To map from b to s basis:
<div class="code">
s_img = b_img(mask)
</div>
To map from s to b basis:
<div class="code">
b_img(mask) = s_img
</div>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Read a mesh, and create a basis mapper to map a nodal image into a regular grid that can be
displayed by Matlab:
<div class="code">
hMesh = toastReadMesh('MyMesh.msh');<br>
hBasis = toastSetBasis(hMesh,[128 128]);<br>
h_img = toastReadNIM('nodal_mua.nim');<br>
b_img = toastMapMeshToBasis(hBasis,h_img);<br>
imagesc(reshape(b_img,64,64));<br>
toastDeleteBasis(hBasis);<br>
toastDeleteMesh(hMesh);
</div>
