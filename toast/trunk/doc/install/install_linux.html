<h1>Toast++ Linux installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Compiler</h3>
<p>For compiling the Toast++ C++ libraries, you need the GNU compiler family, including gcc, g++ and gfortran, version 4.2 or later. Note that if you also want to compile the Matlab toolbox, you have to make sure that your version of gcc is compatible with your version of Matlab. The Mathworks website has a compatibility list for recent Matlab versions.</p>
<p>If there are multiple compiler versions installed on your system, you can select a specific one by setting the following environment variables <i>before</i> configuring Toast: <i>CC</i> (for the C compiler), <i>CXX</i> (for the C++ compiler), and <i>F77</i> (for the Fortran compiler). Example:</p>
<p class="code">
  export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.7<br />
  export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.7<br />
  export F77=/usr/bin/gfortran-4.7
</p>

<h3>Matlab toolbox</h3>
<p>For compiling the Matlab toolbox, you need the Matlab mex compiler for your Matlab version. See above for compatibility considerations. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab 2012b to 2015b. Later versions may or may not work.</p>

<h3>Python module</h3>
<p>For compiling the Python Toast++ module, you need Python installed on your system. Toast++ has been tested with Python 2.7.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>If you want to compile the source-level documentation, you need doxygen (found at <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/</a>).</p>

<h3>External libraries</h3>
<p>Toast++ can make use of optional external libraries for including additional functionality and improving performance. See below under <emph>Configuration</emph> for details.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Before configuring the compilation scripts, you need to set the <emph>TOASTDIR</emph> environment variable:</p>

<p class="code">cd &lt;<i>toast-root</i>&gt;<br />
setenv&nbsp;TOASTDIR&nbsp;$PWD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green"># for csh, or</font><br />
export&nbsp;TOASTDIR=$PWD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green"># for bash</font></p>

<p>Configure the makefiles. In the simplest case (without any additional options), just type</p>
<p class="code">./configure</p>
<p>To display a list of available options, type</p>
<p class="code">./configure --help</p>

<h3>Common configuration options</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Debug version:</b> To compile toast with debugging symbols and additional run-time checks, add the following option to your configure command:
<p class="code">--enable-debug</p>
Note that the debugging version will be slower.</li>
<li><b>Thread support:</b> Toast++ uses the POSIX thread library (pthreads) to accelerate certain operations such as matrix assembly and solution on shared-memory platforms. To compile Toast++ with thread support, add the following option to your configure command:
<p class="code">--enable-threads</p>
</li>
<li><b>Fluorescence imaging support:</b> To add support for fluorescence reconstruction (fDOT), you need to add a the following option to your configure command:
<p class="code">--enable-fdot</p>Note that the fluorescence
module includes code for projecting source distributions onto a mesh surface,
and exitance measurements from the mesh surface to an imaging system. The
projection code requires the libraries and header files of the Mesa 3D Graphics
Library (http://www.mesa3d.org/) installed on your system.
Mesa (and in particular the Mesa header files) may not be installed by default on Linux systems. On Ubuntu, you need to make sure that the following packages are installed:
<ul>
  <li>libgl1-mesa</li>
  <li>libgl1-mesa-dev</li>
  <li>libglu1-mesa</li>
  <li>libglu1-mesa-dev</li>
  <li>libosmesa6</li>
  <li>libosmesa6-dev</li>
</ul>
If Mesa is not installed in a standard system location, you can specify the directories with the --with-mesa=&lt;path&gt;, --with-mesa-includedir=&lt;path&gt; and --with-mesa-libdir=&lt;path&gt; configuration options. You may also have to adapt your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_RUN_PATH environment variables accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>After configuring, set the Toast++ environment by running</p>
<p class="code">source&nbsp;toastenv.csh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green"># for csh, or</font><br />
source&nbsp;toastenv.sh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green"># for bash</font></p>

<h2>Compilation</h2>
<h3>Core libraries</h3>
<p>To build the Toast++ libraries, including the 3rd-party dependencies, type</p>
<p class="code">make</p>

<h3>Matlab bindings</h3>
<p>After building the core libraries, you can also compile the mex files for the Matlab bindings. In the Toast++ main directory, type</p>
<p class="code">make&nbsp;matlab2</font></p>
<p>Once the mex files have been built, from the Matlab prompt, run the script</p>
<p class="code">mtoast2_install</p>
<p>(located in the Toast main folder). This will open the Matlab path tool and allow you to save the paths for the Toast++ toolbox, so Matlab can locate them in future sessions. Note that if you don't have write access to the Matlab installation directories, Matlab will offer to save the paths in a local directory. In that case, you will have to start Matlab from that directory if you want it to load the paths. Otherwise, you will have to run mtoast2_install again.</p>

<h3>Python bindings</h3>
<p>To build the Python module, type</p>
<p class="code">make python</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>To bild the source-level documentation, type</p>
<p class="code">make doc</p>
<p>To run the tests, type</p>
<p class="code">make test</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Fortran compiler problems</h3>
<p>The Fortran libraries must be compiled with gfortran, <emph>not</emph> with g77 which was part of older GNU compiler installations. If you use g77, you will get linker errors related to mismatched underscores in the symbol names exported by the Fortran compilers (this only seems to happen on 64-bit architectures).</p>
