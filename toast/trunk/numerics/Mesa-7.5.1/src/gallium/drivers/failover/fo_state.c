/* This looks like a lot of work at the moment - we're keeping a
 * duplicate copy of the state up-to-date.  
 *
 * This can change in two ways:
 * - With constant state objects we would only need to save a pointer,
 *     not the whole object.
 * - By adding a callback in the state tracker to re-emit state.  The
 *     state tracker knows the current state already and can re-emit it 
 *     without additional complexity.
 *
 * This works as a proof-of-concept, but a final version will have
 * lower overheads.
