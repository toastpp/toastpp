/**
 * \brief Templated forward solver class
 *
 * %TDGFwdSolver is a template class which encapsulates the FEM diffusion forward
 * solver. It can be instantiated either as TDGFwdSolver<double> (or RDGFwdSolver
 * for short) to describe real-valued problems (continuous-wave measurements),
 * or as TDGFwdSolver<complex> (or CDGFwdSolver) for complex-valued problems
 * (frequency domain problems).
 *
 * The %TDGFwdSolver class has an associated linear solver (defined in the
 * constructor) for solving the linear FEM system. This can be either a
 * direct solver (Cholesky for TDGFwdSolver<double> and LU for
 * TDGFwdSolver<complex>), or an iterative method (CG, BiCG, BiCGSTAB, GMRES).
 * For iterative methods, a tolerance limit is also required.
 *
 * Each %TDGFwdSolver instance has an FEM mesh associated with it. The mesh is
 * defined by a call to \ref Allocate, which also constructs the sparse system
 * matrix structure based on the mesh connectivity graph.
 *
 * The system matrix is built with a call to \ref Reset for a given set of
 * nodal optical coefficients. Subsequently, the photon density field (given
 * a source vector) can be evaluated with \ref CalcField and \ref CalcFields,
 * and the measurement values on the boundary can be obtained with
 * \ref Project and \ref ProjectAll.
