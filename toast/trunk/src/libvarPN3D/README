PN_varOrd documentation
	This command runs the variable order spherical harmonic expansion with finite elements in 2D and 3D based on the spatial mesh provided. 
	Notes: 1. It has been coarse-grain-parallelized using pthreads to solve parallely for multiple sources.
	       2. Uses P1 solution on the same mesh as a preconditioner making it faster compared to using Jacobi preconditioning.
	       3. Has the capability to handle both 2D and 3D geometries.
	       4. Can handle cosine, directed and laser source profiles.
	       5. Highly memory optimized to run for 3D applications.
	       6. Handles both vacuum and reflective boundary conditions.

Inputs:
	-nt(default=1)			Number of threads to be used in this computation (System dependant).
	-mesh				A standard TOAST format mesh which can be either in 2D or 3D.
	-qm(optional) 			A standard TOAST format QM file giving the source spatial distributions.
	-g(default=0)   		The parameter 'g' in Henyey-Greenstein phase function -1 <= g <= 1.
	-freq(default=100)   		Modulation frequency in MHz.
	-sap(default=1)			Source angular profile (0. Directed 1. Cosine 2. Uncollided line source).
	-dir				Direction vector along which the source has to be pointed in 2D or 3D.
					NOTE:
					    If unspecified the edge normal (pointing inwards for boundary sources) is chosen as the direction. 
											
	-prefix				String input which is prefixed to the output files.
	-BCType(default='v')		Boundary conditions to be used ('v' for vacuum and 'r' for reflective boundary conditions).
	-ri_external(default=1.0)	Refractive index of the medium outside the tissue.
	-prm 				An input text file containing the absorption, scattering and refractive index for each element
						in that particular order.
	-nodal_sphorder			An input text file containing the order of spherical harmonics to be used on each node.
	-nq(optional)			Specify the number of sources when a QM file has not been provided.
					NOTE:
						When this option is used, enter source node numbers in 0-based index when prompted.
	-nm(optional) 			Specify the number of detectors when a QM file has not been provided.
					NOTE:
						Enter the detector node numbers in 0-based index when prompted.

Outputs:
	<prefix>_re.nim		This file contains real part of photon density.
				Read this file using Matlab TOAST with the command "toastReadNIM"
	
	<prefix>_im.nim		This file contains the imaginary part of photon density. 
				Read as above.

	<prefix>_time.txt	This file contains the time taken to solve for all the sources.
	
	<prefix>_Phi_re.sol	This is an ASCII file containing the real part of radiance (required for Jacobian construction).

	<prefix>_Phi_im.sol	This is an ASCII file containing the imaginary part of radiance (required for Jacobian construction).

	<prefix>_RHS_re.sol	This is an ASCII file containing the real part of the source vector (required for Jacobian construction).

	<prefix>_RHS_im.sol	This is an ASCII file containing the imaginary part of the source vector (required for Jacobian construction).
	
	<prefix>_Det_re.sol 	This is an ASCII file containing the real part of the detector vector (required for Jacobian construction).

	<prefix>_Det_im.sol 	This is an ASCII file containing the imaginary part of the detector vector (required for Jacobian construction).

Warning:
	Internal sources SHOULD NOT be specified using QM file. Use -nq and -nm options instead and DO NOT provide -qm option.
