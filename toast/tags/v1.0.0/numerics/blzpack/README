   The current directory is organized as follows:

   .d2s    : script file to generate single precision codes.
   README  : this file.
   cleaner : script file to perform cleaning operations.
   creator : script file to generate the library libblzpack.a.
   doc     : documentation about BLZPACK.
   drv     : driver models and small examples.
   etc     : contains BLAS kernels and auxiliary routines.
   lib     : reserved for libblzpack.a.
   src     : BLZPACK subprograms.
   sys     : system dependencies.


Purpose:
-------

   BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage) is a set of subprograms written
   in standard Fortran 77 intended for the computation of eigenvalues
   eig and eigenvectors (x) of the "standard" eigenvalue problem

          (A)*(x) - eig*(x) = (0)

   or of the "generalized" eigenvalue problem

          (A)*(x) - eig*(B)*(x) = (0)

   where (A) and (B) are N x N real, sparse, symmetric matrices, eig an
   eigenvalue, and (x) an eigenvector. It is assumed that there exists 
   a linear combination of (A) and (B) which is positive definite to
   guarantee that all eigenvalues are real.

Conditions of use:
-----------------

   BLZPACK has been developed by Osni Marques as a research tool for
   the scientific community. It comes with no guarantee that it is free
   of errors or suitable for a particular application. Therefore, no
   guarantee is given on the results obtained, whose interpretation
   is left to the user. However, comments or reported problems may 
   be sent to:

          osni@nersc.gov
               or
          osni@cs.berkeley.edu

   For an updated list of modifications see file doc/patches.txt.

Creating libblzpack.a:
---------------------

   The (csh shell) script file `creator' provided in this directory is 
   intended for the generation of the library libblzpack.a, which will 
   be placed in the subdirectory lib. The command

          creator -h 

   displays the options and machines currently supported by the script.
   `creator' should be modified accordingly on machines not listed, and
   system dependencies should be defined in the subdirectory sys. See
   the README file in the subdirectory sys for details. Changes in the
   compiler options for the machines currently supported should be also
   performed there. Alternatively, the user may define his own options
   and pass that information to `creator' by means of

          creator -m file_containing_macros

   NB: `creator' relies upon the proper definition of paths and the 
   ==  Fortran compiler by the user.

Testing the library:
-------------------

   Test drivers can be generated by means of the Makefile provided in
   the subdirectory drv/data. Alternatively,

          creator -test 

   runs a set of tests after the library has been installed, using
   examples from the subdirectory drv (output files are placed in
   the subdirectory drv/data). 

   NB: The driver models for the generalized eigenvalue problems use
   ==  routines that are not included in this distribution. However,
       those driver models can be easily modified by the user.
   
BLAS Kernels:
------------

   A set of BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) kernels is used by 
   libblzpack.a and should be made available when linking the package 
   to a calling program. If no library with such kernels is available, 
   the user can include the required files (which are available in the 
   subdirectory etc) by specifying the option `-f' for the script
   `creator'.

LAPACK:
------

   The O(N**2) symmetric tridiagonal eigensolvers available in the 
   LAPACK library (version 3.0 or later) can be used to solve the
   reduced symmetric eigenproblem generated by BLZPACK. See the
   README file in the subdirectory sys for details.
