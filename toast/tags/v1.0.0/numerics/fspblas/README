Section 0.   Release Notes
-----------------------------
 
What's included:
 
    The package includes support for the computational routines in
  the Toolkit (see reference above), including matrix-multiply and 
  triangular solve routines for the following sparse matrix formats:
 
            csr -  compressed sparse row
            csc -  compressed sparse column
            coo -  coordinate  (matrix multiply only)
            bsr -  block sparse row
            bsc -  block sparse column
            bco -  block coordinate (matrix multiply only)
            vbr -  variable block row
            dia -  diagonal 
            ell -  Ellpack 
            jad -  jagged diagonal
            sky -  skyline
            bdi -  block diagonal
            bel -  block Ellpack
 
What's  * NOT *  included:
 
    The following is **NOT** included in this release:
      --  support for non-contiguous block storage in the block formats
      --  support for integrity checking for sparse matrix representations
          (i.e. the routines 'XYYYCK' described in the Toolkit reference.
 
What's required:
 
    Minimum:  Fortran compiler
              BLAS library (available through Netlib at URL:
                            http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas.shar)
               
    Optional: C compiler (for performance testing routines)
 
Testing:
 
    The testing directories contain both matrix-multiply and triangular
  solve testers for each supported storage scheme.  These testers can
  be used as examples of subroutine usage.  The subdirectory ./test/matlab
  contains .mat files containing the test matrices used in the Fortran
  testing routines.  These files can be used along with the Fortran to
  illustrate usage of the storage formats.
 
    This distribution has been tested under the following OS/compiler
  configurations:
 
         sunos4.1.4:     SC3.0.1
         sunsolaris2.5:  FORTRAN 77 4.0
         AIX.4.1.5:      AIX XL Fortran Compiler 3.2 
 
Bug reports:
 
  Please send bug reports to kremington@nist.gov.
 
---------------------------------------
Section 1.   Installation Intructions
---------------------------------------
 
   The installation of the Sparse BLAS Toolkit is automated with
the "make" utility.  To use "make" to build the library:
 
   1.  Edit the file ./makefile.def to reflect your system setup:

 
         - The minimum installation requires an Fortran compiler.
         - An extended installation which includes C performance
           testing routines is available.
         - The archival process by default uses "ranlib". If this
           is not available on your system, set HASRANLIB to 'f'.
 
   2.  Type:
 
       "make library"      to build the archive file ./lib/libsptk.a
                           (tests are not built)
       "make test"         to build and run the testers
 
   3.  For space-saving cleanup, type "make clean" to remove all .o files.
 
--------------------------------
Section 2.   Toolkit Interface
--------------------------------
 
    The Toolkit interface, along with the decision trees for
    calling the proper kernel routine for a given set of input
    values are implemented in the ./src subdirectory.
