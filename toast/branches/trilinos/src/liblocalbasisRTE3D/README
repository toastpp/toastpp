This library produces a binary which can used to run local basis FEM simulation using RTE for the case 'g=0'. 
Note that the 'g' has been limited to zero for time efficiency.

Angular meshes of different levels of refinement have been provided here
octohedron.msh - a simple octohedron
octohedronR2.msh - Octohedron refined 2 levels
octohedronR3.msh - Octohedron refined 3 levels
octohedronR4.msh - Octohedron refined 4 levels
octohedronR5.msh - Octohedron refined 5 levels
octohedronR6.msh - Octohedron refined 6 levels

Usage 
1. $TOASTVER/bin/rte3D_localbasis <spatial mesh name> <angular mesh name> < <input file name>

2. $TOASTVER/bin/rte3D_localbasis <spatial mesh name> <angular mesh name> <QM file name> < <input file name>

eg: $TOASTVER/bin/rte3D_localbasis cube10.msh octohedronR2.msh < inputfile.txt

The input file can be generated using the MATLAB script 'generateInputFile.m'.
