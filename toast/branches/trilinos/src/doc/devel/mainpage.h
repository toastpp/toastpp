/**
 * \mainpage TOAST Source Documentation
 *
 * TOAST is a collection of libraries and applications for the numerical
 * solution of partial differential equations with a finite element method.
 *
 * Originally, TOAST has been developed for modelling diffuse light transport
 * in scattering media, but more recently has been adapted to linear elastic
 * modelling of soft tissue deformation.
 *
 * TOAST is written entirely in C++ (linking to some external numerics
 * libraries). A MATLAB interface is currently under development.
 *
 * TOAST is maintained by Martin Schweiger and Simon Arridge.
