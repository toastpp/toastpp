/**
 * \mainpage TOAST User Guide
 *
 * TOAST is a collection of libraries and applications for the numerical
 * solution of partial differential equations with a finite element method.
 *
 * Originally, TOAST has been developed for modelling diffuse light transport
 * in scattering media, but more recently has been adapted to linear elastic
 * modelling of soft tissue deformation.
 *
 * TOAST consists of a set of command line applications containing forward
 * and inverse solvers, as well as various utility functions. This document
 * contains a short description of the available functions.
 *
 * TOAST also has a Matlab toolbox interface which is documented in
 * Matlab.
 *
 * TOAST is maintained by Martin Schweiger and Simon Arridge.
