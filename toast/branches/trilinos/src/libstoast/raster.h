     * This vector is of length slen (solution dimension). Each entry contains
     * the index of the corresponding element in the basis vector (range
     * 0 .. blen-1). Used to map between basis representation (full bounding
     * box) and solution representation (supported voxels only).
     * \note By default, this vector is constructed from the element support
     *   array for the basis voxels. This may need to be redefined by
     *   derived classes to accommodate their basis function support areas.
