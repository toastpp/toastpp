<h1>Toast++ Windows installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Compiler</h3>
<p>You will need Visual Studio 2008 or later to compile the toast libraries,
executables and mex files. The VS project files included are for VS2008,
but Visual Studio can convert them to later versions.</p>

<h3>Matlab toolbox</h3>
<p>For compiling the Matlab toolbox, you need the Matlab mex compiler for your Matlab version. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab 2012b. Later versions may or may not work.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>If you want to compile the source-level documentation, you need doxygen (found at <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/</a>).</p>

<h3>External libraries</h3>
<p>Toast++ can make use of optional external libraries for including additional functionality and improving performance. See next section for details.</p>

<h2>Support for external libraries</h2>
<p>Toast supports a number of optional external libraries that can enhance
functionality and performance.<p>

<p>To build Toast with linkings to these external libraries in Windows, you
need to</p>
<ul>
<li>download and install the libraries from their respective web sites</li>
<li>configure the Toast project files to link to them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pthreads support</h3>
<p>Toast can use threads to speed up certain operations on shared memory
parallel (SMP) architectures. Toast is using the POSIX thread library
(pthreads). To build Toast with pthreads support</p>

<ul>
<li>download a Windows pthreads library for your architecture (Win32 or
  x64), for example from here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/</a></li>
<li>In visual Studio, open the Toast solution (&lt;toast-root&gt;\win\VS2008\toast.sln)</li>
<li>Open the Project Manager for the libmath project.</li>
<li>Open the "packages" property sheet.</li>
<li>Under Common Properties | General | Inherited Project Property Sheets, add
  .\pthreads.vsprops</li>
<li>Click "Apply"</li>
<li>Open the "pthreads" property sheet that has now been inserted under "packages".</li>
<li>Go to Common Properties | User macros</li>
<li>Edit the "PthreadsDir", "PthreadsLibDir", "PthreadsIncludeDir" and
  "PthreadsLibName" macros to your pthreads installation. If you are using
  a common directory tree for your external Toast dependencies, you can make
  use of the "ExtPackageDir" macro defined in the "packages" property sheet.
  (you will have to edit the macro first).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Compilation</h2>
<h3>Core libraries</h3>
<p>From the VS development environment, load the toast solution file located in</p>
<p class="code">win/VS2008/toast.sln</p>
<p>Set the target configuration and platform (e.g. "Release" and "x64"), and build all. If you are using a later version of Visual Studio, you may have to let it convert the solution and project files.</p>

<h3>Matlab bindings</h3>
<p>After building the core libraries, you can also compile the mex files for the Matlab bindings. Load either of the</p>
<p class="code">toast_matlab.sln&nbsp;&nbsp;<emph>or</emph>&nbsp;&nbsp;toast2_matlab.sln</p>
<p>solution files and build. (You can compile both interfaces, but your matlab script can
only access one of the interfaces at a time).</p>
<p>Once the mex files have been built, from inside Matlab, run the script</p>
<p class="code">mtoast_install&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green">% for interface v1, or</font><br />
mtoast2_install&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font style="color:green">% for interface v2</font></p>
<p>This will open the Matlab path tool and allow you to save the paths for the Toast++ toolbox, so Matlab can locate them in future sessions. If the script finds Toast paths already present in the path list (e.g. from a previous installation) you should delete them when prompted. Note that if you don't have write access to the Matlab installation directories, Matlab will offer to save the paths in a local directory. In that case, you will have to start Matlab from that directory if you want it to load the paths. Otherwise, you will have to run mtoast_install or mtoast2_install again.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>To bild the source-level documentation, you need to have Doxygen installed on your system. Run</p>
<p class="code">doxygen Doxyfile</p>
<p>inside the</p>
<p class="code">&lt;toast-root&gt;/src/doc/devel</p>
<p>directory.</p>
