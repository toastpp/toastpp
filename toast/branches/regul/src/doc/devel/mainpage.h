/**
 * \mainpage Toast++ Source Documentation
 *
 * Toast++ is an open-source collection of libraries and applications for the
 * numerical solution of partial differential equations with the finite element
 * method.
 *
 * Toast++ has been developed for modelling diffuse light transport
 * in scattering media, but can also be adapted to other problems, such as
 * linear elastic modelling of soft tissue deformation.
 *
 * This documentation covers the C++ interface to the Toast++ core libraries.
 * Documentation for the high-level Matlab and Python interfaces to Toast++
 * is available in separate documents.
 *
 * For details on Toast++, see http://toastplusplus.org.
 * Sources and binary packages are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/toastpp.
 *
 * Toast++ is maintained by Martin Schweiger at University College London.
