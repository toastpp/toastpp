<h1>What is TOAST?</h1>
<p>TOAST is a software suite for image reconstruction in optical diffusion tomography (ODT).
ODT seeks to recover the spatial distribution of the optical parameters of a scattering object from
boundary measurements of light transmission between a set of infrared light sources and a set of detectors.
<p>The main application of ODT is in medical imaging, where the optical parameters are related to important
physiological tissue parameters such as the oxygenation level of blood and tissue.
<p>Parameter reconstruction in ODT is a nonlinear ill-posed inverse problem. Infrared light is highly
scattered in biological tissues, and propagates as a diffuse photon density wave rather than in a straight
path. The spatital sensitivity distribution of a measurement (photon measurement density function, PMDF)
depends itself on the unknown optical parameters.
<p>TOAST uses a model-based iterative approach to the ODT reconstruction problem. A numerical model of
diffuse light transport is applied to the current parameter estimate at each step, and an objective function
is defined as a norm of the difference between measurement and model data. The reconstruction problem is then
formulated in terms of minimisation of the objective function. The problem is linearised around the current
estimate at each step to find an update direction and update step.

<h2>TOAST Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Available for Windows and Linux platforms.
<li>Diffusion light transport model using a finite element (FEM) forward solver.
<li>Can be applied to 2D and 3D problems.
<li>Multiple element types (triangles, tetrahedra, pixels, voxels) and multiple orders of polynomial
shape functions (linear, quadratic cubic) to accommodate different problem geometries.
<li>Selection of inverse solvers (gradient-type, Newton-type)
<li>Selection of regularisation methods
</ul>

<h2>Where to get TOAST</h2>
TOAST is being developed by Martin Schweiger and Simon Arridge at University College London, UK. The TOAST
executables for Windows and Linux can be downloaded for free from the
<a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vis/toast/">TOAST web site</a>.

Why 'TOAST'?<br>
TOAST stands for 'Time-resolved Optical Absorption and Scattering Tomography'. Although the current version
of TOAST emphasizes frequency-domain measurement systems, we have kept the acronym, because 'FOAST' hasn't
got quite the same ring to it.
