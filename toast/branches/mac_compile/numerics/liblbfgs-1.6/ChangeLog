	* libLBFGS 1.5:
	- Configurable starting index for L1-norm computation. A member
	  variable lbfgs_parameter_t::orthantwise_start was added to specify
	  the index number from which the library computes the L1 norm of the
	  variables.
	- Fixed a zero-division error when the initial variables have already
	  been a minimizer (reported by Takashi Imamichi). In this case, the
	  library returns LBFGS_ALREADY_MINIMIZED status code.
	- Defined LBFGS_SUCCESS status code as zero; removed unused constants,
	  LBFGSFALSE and LBFGSTRUE.
	- Fixed a compile error in an implicit down-cast.

	* libLBFGS 1.4:
	- Configurable line search algorithms. A member variable
	  lbfgs_parameter_t::linesearch was added to choose either MoreThuente
	  method (LBFGS_LINESEARCH_MORETHUENTE) or backtracking algorithm
	  (LBFGS_LINESEARCH_BACKTRACKING).
	- Fixed a bug: the previous version did not compute psuedo-gradients
	  properly in the line search routines for OW-LQN. This bug might quit
	  an iteration process too early when the OW-LQN routine was activated
	  (0 < lbfgs_parameter_t::orthantwise_c).
	- Configure script for POSIX environments.
	- SSE/SSE2 optimizations with GCC.
	- New functions lbfgs_malloc and lbfgs_free to use SSE/SSE2 routines
	  transparently. It is uncessary to use these functions for libLBFGS
	  built without SSE/SSE2 routines; you can still use any memory
	  allocators if SSE/SSE2 routines are disabled in libLBFGS.

	* libLBFGS 1.3:
	- An API change. An argument was added to lbfgs() function to receive
	  the final value of the objective function. This argument can be set
	  to NULL if the final value is unnecessary.
	- Fixed a null-pointer bug in the sample code (reported by Takashi
	  Imamichi).
	- Added build scripts for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and GCC.
	- Added README file.

	* libLBFGS 1.2:
	- Fixed a serious bug in orthant-wise L-BFGS. An important variable
	  was used without initialization.
	- Configurable L-BFGS parameters (number of limited memories, epsilon).

	- Implemented lbfgs_parameter_init() function.
	- Fixed several bugs.
	- API documentation.
